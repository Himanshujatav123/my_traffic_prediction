Source: Kaggle â€“ Metro Interstate Traffic Volume

Features:

traffic_volume (Target): Number of cars per hour.

temp: Temperature in Kelvin.

rain_1h, snow_1h: Rain/snow in the past hour (mm).

clouds_all: Cloud coverage percentage.

date_time: Timestamp of the observation.

 Objective
Build a deep learning model (LSTM) that can:

Learn from past hourly data

Predict future traffic volume

Help in better urban planning & traffic management

 Tools & Technologies Used
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

Scikit-learn (Preprocessing)

TensorFlow/Keras (Model building)

Google Colab (for training and experimentation)

 Model Architecture
Input: Past 24-hour features (temperature, cloud, rain, etc.)

LSTM Layer: 64 units

Dense Layer: 1 output neuron for traffic prediction

Loss Function: Mean Squared Error

Optimizer: Adam

Trained for 10 epochs

 Results
The model was able to learn trends and seasonal variations in traffic.

Plot of actual vs predicted traffic shows good approximation for peak and low traffic periods.

 How to Use
Upload the dataset on Google Colab.

Run the Traffic_Prediction.ipynb notebook.

Visualize and analyze the prediction results.

 Conclusion
This project shows the power of LSTM models in handling time-series forecasting problems. The same approach can be extended to:

Predict electricity usage

Stock prices

Weather conditions
